					<h1>FAQ</h1>
				</div>
				<h4>What is Wordcorp?</h4>
				<p>
					Founded in 2010, Wordcorp is an American-operated professional
					translation service and language consultancy based in Taiwan that
					seeks to connect East with West through language and exchange.
				</p>
				<h4>Why Taiwan?</h4>
				<p>
					Seated between China and America, Taiwan serves as both a literal and
					figurative connection between East and West. Taiwan not only retains
					the most traditional roots of Chinese culture, but also embodies a
					rich colonial history that has prompted its development into an
					amalgamation of diverse cultures and languages.
				</p>
				<h4>What is thewordcorp.com?</h4>
				<p>
					thewordcorp.com is a site through which users may place, purchase, and
					keep track of orders for document translation service from Wordcorp.
					To improve user experience, the site itself will be continuously
					updated with new functions, designs, tools, and services. Please be
					sure to stay tuned for new announcements and any changes to the Terms
					of Service.
				</p>
				<h4>How is the word count for my projects calculated?</h4>
				<p>
					Wordcorp employs a very conservative approach to counting the words in
					your document(s): For English to Chinese service, only English words
					are included in the word count; punctuations, symbols, and numbers are
					excluded. For Chinese to English service, only Han characters and the
					following symbols listed below are counted:
					？！；．〜ー。，「」《、》【】『』：（）（）／・
				</p>
				<h4>
					What types of documents does thewordcorp.com support?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Currently, thewordcorp.com’s automated quoting system only supports
					text-based documents, such as .doc, .docx, .rtf and .txt. When
					uploading other types of documents, your project will be instantly
					directed to our Project Manager, who will provide you with a quote to
					the email address you provide.
				</p>
				<h4>
					If I have text embedded within a picture image, will that be
					translated?
				</h4>
				<p>
					No. Since text within a picture image cannot be distinguished by the
					system, they will not be included in the word count, price, or
					translation. If you have text within a picture image that you would
					like translated, please manually type them as text within your
					document to ensure their translation.
				</p>
				<h4>Why is the delivery date for my project only an estimation?</h4>
				<p>
					The delivery date you receive is an automated estimation of the time
					required to complete a thorough translation based purely on your
					project’s word count. Since the content of some documents may be more
					technical than others, the length of time required may surpass the
					estimated delivery date. However, please note that the majority of
					translations are completed and delivered at a time before their
					estimated delivery dates.
				</p>
				<h4>How are translations conducted? Is there an editing process?</h4>
				<p>
					All translations by Wordcorp are conducted purely by qualified
					native-language personnel. Before delivery, each translation is
					thoroughly reviewed by a professional editor to ensure that it
					captures the meaning of the original text in a grammatically correct
					format.
				</p>
				<h4>
					How would I report any issues with a translation?
				</h4>
				<p>
					If you notice any problems in the translation, please highlight the
					section(s), leave a helpful comment, and send the document to
					<a href="mailto:service@thewordcorp.com">service@thewordcorp.com</a>.
					Our editors will review and make any appropriate revisions within a 48
					hour period. You will be notified via email once the revisions are
					complete. Please be aware that if you do not report an issue within a
					week after the project is delivered, it will be considered a finished
					project. After that time, Wordcorp will have the discretion to refuse
					requests for any further reviews and revisions.
				</p>
				<h4>What types of issues will be considered for revision?</h4>
				<p>
					Issues regarding grammar and translation will be considered for
					revision. However, Wordcorp translators and editors may choose to
					ignore requests for any stylistic changes.
				</p>
				<h4>What is the refund/cancellation policy?</h4>
				<p>
					Refunds and cancellations will not be allowed once a translator has
					started on your project. You may check the status of your project in
					your dashboard. If you would like to cancel a translation that has not
					yet been translated, please email
					<a href="mailto:service@thewordcorp.com">service@thewordcorp.com</a>
				</p>
				<h4>
					How is my personal information used by Wordcorp?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Your personal information will only be used by Wordcorp for the
					purposes of providing its translation services. Your personal
					information will never be provided to any third-party entities without
					your written or expressed consent.
				</p>
				<h4>
					I am interested in working as a translator or editor for Wordcorp. How
					do I apply?
				</h4>
				<p>
					To become a registered translator or editor for Wordcorp, all
					interested applicants who are legally permitted to work in Taiwan may
					e-mail a short introduction to us at
					<a href="mailto:service@thewordcorp.com">service@thewordcorp.com</a>.
					Depending on the position you are seeking, you will be asked to
					complete one to two tests that gauge your 1) understanding of the
					content and language of an original text and 2) ability to express
					that content through an accurate and grammatically correct
					translation. After submission, your sample will be carefully reviewed.
					Please allow 3 business days for a reply on whether you have been
					approved for registration.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Why must I be legally permitted to work in Taiwan to apply for
					Wordcorp?
				</h4>
				<p>
					For now, Wordcorp is a translation service based only in Taiwan. As a
					result, the translators and editors we employ must be legally
					permitted to work in Taiwan. These conditions will change in the near
					future as we continue to expand our scope of operations. Please stay
					tuned.
				</p>
				<h4>
					I have successfully registered as a translator/editor for Wordcorp.
					What now?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Once you have registered as a translator or editor, you will be
					granted the appropriate permissions. You will start receiving emails
					notifying you of new cases that have been uploaded. By logging into
					your dashboard, you may review the details of the case as well as
					preview the document(s) before assigning yourself to them. Once you
					have successfully assigned yourself to a project, you may proceed with
					the translation. Please note that you will not be able to see cases
					that have already been taken by other translators/editors.
				</p>
				<h4>
					What happens if I am late with delivering a translation or editing
					project?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Before you assign yourself to a project, you should review its details
					very carefully, particularly its delivery date and word count. We
					expect all our translators/editors to make sure that they will be able
					to complete and submit projects by their designated delivery dates. If
					you believe that you will not be able to complete an assigned project
					by the designated delivery date, please email
					<a href="mailto:service@thewordcorp.com">service@thewordcorp.com</a>
					immediately so that we may take appropriate action. Wordcorp employs a
					zero-tolerance policy for any translator/editor who misses their
					deadline without providing any prior notice. Please be sure to keep
					track of all your assigned cases.
				</p>
				<h4>
					Hypothetically, what happens if I intentionally do a rushed, careless
					job with my project? Who will notice?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Wordcorp places the responsibility of ensuring the quality of work
					solely on the translator/editor team for each project. After the
					delivery of a project, customers will have a 168 hour period to review
					and report any issues with the translation. If the customer does not
					report any issues within that period, or chooses to click on “Approve”
					for the project, the fees for that project will be released to the
					translator/editor team on the next payout date. However, if the
					customer reports an issue, the translator/editor team will be
					responsible for making the appropriate revisions within a 48 hour
					period.
				</p>
				<h4>
					What types of issues should I consider for revision?
				</h4>
				<p>
					Issues regarding grammar and translation should be considered for
					revision. However, Wordcorp translators and editors may choose to heed
					requests for any stylistic changes at their discretion.
				</p>
				<h4>
					How would I get paid for translations that I have completed and
					submitted?
				</h4>
				<p>
					You will receive accrued payments to a designated bank account of your
					choice on the 1st working day of every month for all your work
					submitted and approved between the 20 - 19 of the previous bimonthly
					period. For example, you would be paid for all your work that was
					approved between January 20 to February 19 on April 1 (a working day).
